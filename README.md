# Project3_AI
Using the Weka Explorer arff data files to create Naive Bayesian stuff. 

Notice: This code was written with the powerpoint 7class as a guide, which shows how to calculate
a classifier for categorical data only. The arff samples that Weka uses, which is the reference 
that this project details includes for some reason, basically don't work. I had to include my
own arff file version of the powerpoint's Tennis example to test my code. I still included
the reference arffs for fun.
